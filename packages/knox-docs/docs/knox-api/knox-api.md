# SamsungKnox API

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@redredgroup%2Fsamsungknox-api.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redredgroup/samsungknox-api)

This library provides utility methods to generate and sign Knox Tokens using server side Javascript. The pre-requisites for using this utility are

- You have downloaded the Knox Credential file (credential.json)
- You have generated a Client Identifier (api-key) for accessing apis of Knox Cloud Services. (Use this package: [@redredgroup/samsungknox-token-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redredgroup/samsungknox-token-library))

The keys below must have Cloud API privileges on Samsung Knox. If you do not have permission, you can request permission by disconnecting the Ticket from the Samsung Knox Admin Portal.
