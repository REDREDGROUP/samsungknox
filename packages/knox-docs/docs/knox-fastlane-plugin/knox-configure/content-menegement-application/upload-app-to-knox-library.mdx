# Upload App to Library

To upload app the **knox library**, use the following methods.

## Example

```Ruby
lane :deploy_to_samsungknox do

 ...your app build step

  knox_configure_library_upload_app(
    credential_key: ENV['CREDENTIAL_KEY'],
    credential_path: 'YOUR_CREDENTIAL_PATH',
    clientIdentifierJwtToken: ENV['CLIENT_IDENTIFIER_JWT_TOKEN'],
    app_description: 'YOUR_APP_DESCRIPTION', #Optinal
    app_file_path: 'YOUR_APP_FILE_PATH',
    api_region: 'YOUR_API_REGION',
  )
end
```

Input parameters:

:::warning
Provide only one of the following: **credential_key** or **credential_path**. The recommendation is to inject the key via an environment variable.
:::

- clientIdentifierJwtToken: Client IdentifierJwtToken Token **(For more information on how to get one, see [here](/docs/knox-token-library/).)**
- credential_key: your credential key (JSON.stringfy) **(For more information on how to get one, see [here](/docs/knox-token-library/).)**
- credential_path: your credential path (JSON.stringfy)
- api_region: Insert the Knox region. Most of them are EU (case insensitive)
- app_description: description of the app. (Optional)
- app_file_path: The path to the built app (must include an extension like .apk)

Output:

- A mantra will be printed stating that the app deployment is complete.
